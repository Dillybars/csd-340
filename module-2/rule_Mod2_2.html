        <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>
        <p class="Dylans intro">I grew up in San Jose, CA. From a young age, I moved to Wisconsin when I was 2. I joined the Air Force right out of high school and was in it for 6 years. One of my jobs was called weapons ordinance when I was in. My family has always been supportive of everything I have done. They always encourage me to pursue my interests and academic goals. I love playing video games in my free time.</p>
        <p>I've always been drawn to technology and computers, which led me to pursue a degree in Software Development. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with web development and learning new programming languages.</p>
        <p>During my time in the military, I had the opportunity to travel abroad and explore different cultures. These experiences really helped me open my eyes to other countries and how they live.</p>
        <p>Now, as I continue my journey with this web development course, I'm excited to apply my skills and creativity to create meaningful projects and contribute to the digital world!</p>
